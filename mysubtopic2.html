      <h2 id="firstheader">Rules when Racing</h2>
      <p style="color: red;">Track is a complicated sport with convoluted rules. It's very easy to
        mess up your times or get disqualified if you don't know what you're
        doing. However, runners that know what they're doing realize how helpful
        the rules really are.</p>

        <ol>
          <li style="color: teal;">Don't cross the track during a competition! While this may seem
              like common sense, meets can be very hard to navigate. Often,
              athletes try to take shortcuts to their destination by cutting
              across the track, but that can interrupt an ongoing race. Only
              officials, coaches, and competing athletes are allowed on the track
              during an event.</li>
          <li id="redlist">Cheering is encouraged, but trash talking can get you disqualified.</li>
          <li style="color: purple;">If you start running even a second before the gun goes off, that is
            considered a false start. Especially with sprints, every second counts.
            A false start would be a really unfair advantage. A double fault (2
            false starts) will equal a DQ (disqualification).</li>
          <li id="silverlist">Grip tape on a baton during a relay race is considered cheating
            and will lead to disqualification.</li>
        </ol>
